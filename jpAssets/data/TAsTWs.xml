<p>Exercise increased caution in Senegal due to <b>elections, crime,</b> and <b>landmines</b>. &nbsp;Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p><b>Presidential elections</b> in Senegal are scheduled for February 24, 2019. If no candidate wins a majority during the initial balloting, a second round will be held, either on March 10, March 17, or March 24, with March 17 the most likely date.</p>
<p>Tensions are typically heightened during campaign and election periods, and some election-related demonstrations and other activities have resulted in violence. &nbsp;The Senegalese government may impose travel restrictions as the elections approaches, sometimes without notice, which may affect travel plans. &nbsp;Expect additional police and military checkpoints and possible road blocks throughout the country during the campaign period and election day itself. &nbsp;Regular road travel between regions is prohibited on election days.</p>
<p>Armed individuals have set up roadblocks and attacked travelers on roads south of The Gambia in the Casamance region of Senegal.</p>
<p>Land mines from prior conflicts remain in the Casamance Region.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in this area. U.S. government employees are prohibited from travelling on National Route 4 south of Ziguinchor, on Route 20 between Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring, and on unpaved roads without armed escorts.&nbsp; U.S. government employees are also prohibited from travelling after dark.</p>

<title>China - Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution</title><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2019</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Exercise increased caution in China due to <b>arbitrary enforcement of local laws as well as special restrictions on dual U.S.-Chinese nationals.</b></p>
<p>Chinese authorities have asserted broad authority to prohibit U.S. citizens from leaving China by using &#8216;exit bans,&#8217; sometimes keeping U.S. citizens in China for years. China uses exit bans coercively:</p>
<ul>
<li>to compel U.S. citizens to participate in Chinese government investigations,</li>
<li>to lure individuals back to China from abroad, and</li>
<li>to aid Chinese authorities in resolving civil disputes in favor of Chinese parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, U.S. citizens only become aware of the exit ban when they attempt to depart China, and there is no method to find out how long the ban may continue. U.S. citizens under exit bans have been harassed and threatened.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to &#8220;state security.&#8221; Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uighur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.</p>
<p>China does not recognize dual nationality. U.S.-Chinese citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and China may prevent the U.S. Embassy from providing consular services.</p>
<p>Read the Safety and Security section on the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html">country information page</a>.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to China:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter China on your U.S. passport with a valid Chinese visa and keep it with you.</li>
<li>If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or the nearest consulate immediately. </li>
<li>If you plan to enter North Korea, read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/KoreaDemocraticPeoplesRepublicof.html">North Korea Travel Advisory</a>.</li>
<li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a> (<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li>
<li>Follow the Department of State on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TravelGov">Twitter</a>.

<title>Syria - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title><pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2018</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/syria-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/syria-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to Syria due to <b>terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict</b>.</p>
<p>No part of Syria is safe from violence. Kidnappings, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with Syria. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The range of consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited, and the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Syria.&nbsp; U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should try to quickly and safely leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, if possible.</p>
<p>A porous border with Iraq and long-standing border issues with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Israel have contributed to a complex security environment in Syria, compounded by a protracted violent conflict and influx of foreign fighters.</p>
<p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.</p>
<p>Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Nusrah Front, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing and increased risk of kidnapping of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, with many abductions having occurred since mid-2012.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. Citizens should consult&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>
<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. &nbsp;Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.everplans.com/articles/checklist-documents-to-organize-and-share">Find a suggested list of such documents here</a></u>.</li>
<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.</li>

<title>North Korea - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/north-korea-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/north-korea-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to North Korea <b>due to the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. nationals. <br>
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals cannot use a U.S. passport to travel to, in, or through North Korea without a special validation from the Department of State.</li>
<li>Special validations are granted only in very limited circumstances. More information on how to apply for the special validation is available <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/passport-for-travel-to-north-korea.html" adhocenable="false">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in North Korea as it does not have diplomatic or consular relations with North Korea. Sweden serves as the protecting power for the United States in North Korea, providing limited emergency services. The North Korean government routinely delays or denies Swedish officials access to detained U.S. citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of North Korea, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<p>Reconsider travel to Chad due to <b>crime</b>, <b>terrorism, </b>and <b>minefields.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Violent crimes, such as armed robbery, carjacking, and muggings, have been reported. There was a significant increase in these crimes in 2018. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting foreigners, local security forces, and civilians. They can easily cross borders, including in the Lake Chad region; borders may close without notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are unmapped and undocumented minefields along the borders with both Libya and Sudan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Chad as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of the capital, including the Lake Chad Basin.</p>

<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within 50 miles of the border with Yemen due to <b>terrorism and armed conflict</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi Arabia. &nbsp;Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.&nbsp; Terrorists have targeted both Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners.</p>
<p>Rebel groups operating in Yemen have fired missiles and rockets into Saudi Arabia, specifically targeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure; they have publicly stated their intent to continue doing so. &nbsp;Missile attacks have targeted major cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah, Riyadh&#8217;s international airport, Saudi Aramco facilities, and vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes.&nbsp; Rebel groups are also in possession of unmanned aerial systems (drones) which they have used to target civilian infrastructure and military facilities in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; U.S. citizens living and working on or near such installations, particularly in areas near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile and drone attack.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following locations as U.S. government personnel and their families are restricted from travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, including the cities of Jizan and Najran;</li>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Exercise increased caution in The Bahamas due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assault, is common, even during the day and in tourist areas. Although the family islands are not crime-free, the vast majority of crime occurs on New Providence and Grand Bahama islands. U.S. government personnel are not permitted to visit the Sand Trap area in Nassau due to crime. Activities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated. Watercraft are often not maintained, and many companies do not have safety certifications to operate in The Bahamas. Jet-ski operators have been known to commit sexual assaults against tourists. &nbsp;As a result, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to use jet-ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Islands.</p>

<p>Reconsider travel to Sudan due to <b>terrorism and civil unrest. </b>Some areas have increased risk. Please read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Darfur region, Blue Nile state, and South Kordofan state due to <b>crime</b> <b>and</b> <b>armed conflict.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Sudan. Terrorist groups in Sudan have stated their intent to harm Westerners and Western interests through suicide operations, bombings, shootings, and kidnappings. They may attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities, and areas frequented by Westerners.</p>
<p>A state of emergency is in effect in Kassala and North Kordofan states, which gives security forces greater arrest powers. Arbitrary detentions, including of foreigners, have been reported across the country. Curfews may be imposed with little or no warning. The Sudanese government does not recognize dual citizenship and is likely to consider U.S.-Sudanese dual citizens as Sudanese citizens only.</p>
<p>Demonstrations, including anti-Western rallies, can occur with no warning. Foreigners could be targeted in reaction to national and international events. Demonstrations are also common before and after Friday prayers.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Sudan, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization from the Sudanese government to travel outside of Khartoum. The U.S. Embassy requires U.S. government personnel in Sudan to use armored vehicles for official travel. Family members under 21 years of age cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Sudan.</p>

<li>Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.</li>
<li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions and answers to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive and to rule out a hoax.</li>
<li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Reconsider travel to Guinea-Bissau due to <b>elections,</b> <b>crime, and civil unrest</b>.</p>
<p>Legislative elections in Guinea-Bissau are scheduled for March 10, 2019. The election date may be subject to change. The risk of violence is heightened during election periods, and in recent elections, some election-related demonstrations have resulted in violence. The Bissau-Guinean government may impose travel restrictions as the elections approach, sometimes without notice, which may affect travel plans. Expect additional police and military checkpoints and possible road blocks throughout the country during elections. Regular road travel is prohibited on election day, and stores will be closed.</p>
<p>Violent crime is common in Guinea-Bissau. Aggressive vendors, panhandlers, and occasionally criminals target foreigners at the Bissau airport and other crowded areas, especially Bandim Market in the center of the capital. Local police lack the resources, capacity, and training to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents.</p>
<p>The country has been beset by chronic political and institutional dysfunction for decades, and there is the potential for violence.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens because there is no U.S. Embassy in Guinea-Bissau.</p>

<p>Exercise increased caution in Eritrea due to&nbsp;<b>travel restrictions, limited consular assistance</b>, <b>and landmines.</b></p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Eritrea, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of Asmara.</p>
<p>Eritrean law enforcement officials routinely block access to foreign nationals in detention. The U.S. Embassy therefore may not receive notification or be allowed access to you if you are detained or arrested.</p>
<p>There are landmines in many remote areas in Eritrea, particularly in Nakfa, AdiKeih, Arezza, the 25 mile-wide region (40 km) between the Setit and Mereb Rivers, and in areas north and west of Keren, areas near Massawa, Ghinda, Agordat, Barentu, Dekemhare, and south of Tessenae.</p>

Terrorists have also previously targeted Western tourists and expatriates.</p>
<p>Security forces have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens, for alleged affiliations with terrorist organizations based on scant or secret evidence and grounds that appear to be politically motivated. U.S. citizens have also been subject to travel bans that prevent them from departing Turkey. Participation in demonstrations not explicitly approved by the Government of Turkey, as well as criticism of the government, including on social media, can result in arrest.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has very limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in Batman, Bingol, Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, Hakkari, Hatay, Kilis, Mardin, Sanliurfa, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli, and Van, as the U.S. government restricts its employees from traveling to specific provinces in these regions without prior approval.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to Afghanistan due to&nbsp;<b>armed conflict, terrorism,</b> <b>crime, and</b>&nbsp;<b>civil unrest</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Travel to all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe because of critical levels of kidnappings, hostage taking, suicide bombings, widespread military combat operations, landmines, and terrorist and insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne, magnetic, or other improvised explosive devices (IEDs), suicide vests, and grenades. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Terrorist and insurgent groups continue planning and executing attacks in Afghanistan. These attacks occur with little or no warning, and have targeted official Afghan and U.S. government convoys and facilities, local government buildings, foreign embassies, military installations, commercial entities, non-governmental organization (NGO) offices, hospitals, residential compounds, tourist locations, transportation hubs, public gatherings, markets and shopping areas, places of worship, restaurants, hotels, universities, airports, schools, gymnasiums, and other locations frequented by U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy's ability to provide routine and emergency services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan is severely limited, particularly outside of Kabul. Evacuation options from Afghanistan are extremely limited due to the lack of infrastructure, geographic constraints, and the volatile security situation.</p>
<p>Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Afghanistan. Unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. government employees and their family members is restricted and requires prior approval from the Department of State. &nbsp;U.S. Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling to all locations in Kabul except the U.S. Embassy and other U.S. government facilities unless there is a compelling U.S. government interest in permitting such travel that outweighs the risk. Additional security measures are needed for any U.S. government employee travel and movement through Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Afghanistan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/" adhocenable="false">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<p>Exercise increased caution in Brazil due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any areas within 150 km of Brazil&#8217;s land borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>. (Note: This does not apply to the Foz do Iguacu National Park or Pantanal National Park.) </li>
<li>Do not use public buses in and around Recife due to <b>crime</b> (see additional information below). </li>
<li>Informal housing developments (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, communidades, and/or conglomerados), at any time of day due to <b>crime</b> (see additional information below).</li>

<li>Recife&#8217;s Pina Beach from Dona Benvinda de Farias Street to the Brasilia Teimosa neighborhood after dark due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b> (see additional information below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, and carjacking, is common in urban areas, day and night. Gang activity and organized crime is widespread. Read the Safety and Security section on the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Brazil.html">country information page</a>.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Brazil:</p>
<ul>

<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li>
<li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.</li>
<li>Avoid walking on beaches after dark.</li>
<li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.</li>
<li>Avoid using an ATM in low-light or remote locations. Never let someone &#8220;shoulder surf&#8221; or assist you.

If you use an ATM, select those located inside of secure facilities, such as an airport, hospital, bank, or government building.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use caution at, or going to, major transportation centers or on public transportation, especially at night. Crime statistics indicate that passengers face an elevated risk of robbery or assault using public, municipal bus transportation throughout Brazil.

<p><b>Public Transportation</b></p>
<p>Crime statistics and trends indicate that persons face an elevated risk of robbery or assault using public bus systems throughout Brazil.

<p><b>Informal Housing Developments (commonly known as &#8220;Favelas&#8221;)</b></p>
<p>Do not travel to informal housing developments (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, communidades, and/or conglomerados), even on a guided tour. Neither the tour companies nor the police can guarantee your safety when entering these communities. Even in these communities that the police or local governments deem safe, the situation can change quickly and without notice. In addition, exercise caution in areas surrounding these communities, as occasionally, inter-gang fighting and confrontations with police move beyond the confines of these communities. Except under limited circumstances and with advance approval, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to enter any informal housing developments in Brazil.

<p>Do Not Travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>North, Far North, Northwest and Southwest Regions, and Parts of East and Adamawa Regions due to <b>crime</b>, <b>terrorism, </b>and<b> civil unrest</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Violent crime, such as armed robbery and carjacking, is common. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Adamawa (to the north or east of Ngaoundere), East (east of Bertoua), North, Far North, Northwest and Southwest Regions of Cameroon due to current official travel restrictions.</p>

<p>If you decide to travel to Cameroon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry.</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent and turn deadly.</li>
<li>Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>North, Far North, Northwest and Southwest Regions, and Parts of East and Adamawa Regions</b></p>
<p>In the North and Far North Regions, as well as parts of East and Adamawa Regions, terrorists may attack with no warning, targeting local facilities and places frequented by Westerners. In Adamawa Region, this threat specifically includes any area to the north or east of Ngaoundere.&nbsp; Kidnapping by terrorists and/or kidnapping for ransom are serious concerns in Cameroon, especially in areas bordering northern Nigeria and the Central African Republic (CAR).</p>
<p>In Northwest and Southwest Regions, an Anglophone separatist movement has led to increased levels of violence. Armed clashes with the government and other acts of violence have occurred.</p>
<p>Violent crime, including kidnapping, armed robbery, assault, and carjacking, is common within 60 miles of the border with Nigeria&#8217;s Adamawa State in the North and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon, the border area with Chad, and the border areas with the CAR.</p>

<p><b>Urban Areas &#8211; Level 2: &nbsp;Exercise Increased Caution</b></p>
<p>Violent crime, such as street mugging, is more frequent in urban areas as compared to their surrounding suburbs. These crimes are also more prevalent at night and in isolated locations.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens.&nbsp; Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to more serious crimes.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Intercity Highways &#8211; Level 2: &nbsp;Exercise Increased Caution</b></p>
<p>Armed assaults on private vehicles and public transports occur more frequently after dark, often by criminal elements utilizing blockades to slow down and restrict movement of vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Brong Ahafo, Northern, and Upper East Regions &#8211; Level 2: &nbsp;Exercise Increased Caution</b></p>
<p>Civil unrest due to chieftaincy disputes can occur at any time. While such disputes are typically non-violent, the likelihood for violence developing from a tribal dispute is greater in parts of these regions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Do not travel to Somalia due to <b>crime</b>, <b>terrorism</b>,<b> </b>and <b>piracy</b>.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as kidnapping and murder, is common throughout Somalia, including Puntland and Somaliland. Illegal roadblocks are also widespread.</p>
<p>A number of schools acting as &#8220;cultural rehabilitation&#8221; facilities are operating throughout Somalia with unknown licensing and oversight. Reports of physical abuse and people being held against their will in these facilities are common.</p>
<p>Terrorists continue to plot kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in Somalia. They may conduct attacks with little or no warning, targeting airports and seaports, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, and other areas where large crowds gather and Westerners frequent, as well as government, military, and Western convoys.</p>
<p>Pirates are active in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially in the international waters near Somalia.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Somalia due to the lack of permanent consular presence in Somalia.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Somalia, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.<i></i></p>

<title>South Sudan - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/south-sudan-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/south-sudan-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to South Sudan due to <b>crime </b>and <b>armed conflict</b>.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.</p>
<p>Armed conflict is ongoing throughout the country and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups, and weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence. Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict in South Sudan.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements in the city, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and must usually be conducted in groups of two or more during daylight hours. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>
<p>Read the Safety and Security section on the <a adhocenable="false" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthSudan.html">country information page</a>.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to South Sudan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba. Travel outside of Juba with a minimum of two vehicles along with appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency.</li>
<li>Avoid travel along border areas.</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent.</li>
<li>Be aware that photography in public is strictly controlled and you are required to obtain authorization from the Ministry of Information before taking any photographs or video in public &#8211; including while inside a vehicle.</li>
<li>Monitor local/international news and&nbsp;<a href="https://ss.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/">consular messages</a>.</li>
<li>Enroll your trip in the State Department's&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program&nbsp;(STEP)</a>.</li>
<li>Review your personal security plan and visit our page on travel to high risk areas.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li>

<li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Your plan should include sheltering in place, maintaining outside communication, and a personal evacuation plan via commercial means.</li>
<li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.</li>
<li>Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.</li>

<li>Crimea due to Russia&#8217;s occupation of the Ukrainian territory<b> and abuses by its occupying authorities</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist groups, transnational and local terrorist organizations, and individuals inspired by extremist ideology continue plotting possible attacks in Russia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Russia have been arbitrarily interrogated or detained by Russian officials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. Russian officials may unreasonably delay U.S. consular assistance to detained U.S. citizens. Russian authorities arbitrarily enforce the law against U.S. citizen religious workers and open questionable criminal investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity.</p>
<p>Russia enforces special restrictions on dual U.S.-Russian nationals and may refuse to acknowledge dual U.S.-Russia nationals&#8217; U.S. citizenship, including denying U.S. consular assistance to detained dual nationals, and preventing their departure from Russia.</p>
<p>Due to the Russian government-imposed reduction on U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia, the U.S. government may have delayed ability to provide services to U.S. citizens, especially in the Saint Petersburg area.</p>

<p><b>North Caucasus (including Chechnya and Mount Elbrus)</b></p>
<p>Terrorist attacks and risk of civil unrest continue throughout the North Caucasus region including in Chechnya, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Stavropol, Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, and Kabardino-Balkariya. Local gangs have kidnapped U.S. citizens and other foreigners for ransom. There have been credible reports of arrest, torture, and extrajudicial killing of LGBTI persons in Chechnya allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.</p>
<p>Do not attempt to climb Mount Elbrus, as travelers must pass close to volatile and insecure areas of the North Caucasus region.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in the North Caucasus region, including Mount Elbrus, as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to the region.</p>

<p><b>Crimea</b></p>
<p>There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in Crimea. The Russian Federation is likely to take further military actions in Crimea as part of its occupation of this part of Ukraine. The international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize Russia&#8217;s purported annexation of Crimea. There are continuing abuses against foreigners and the local population by the&nbsp;occupation authorities in Crimea, particularly against those who are seen as challenging their authority on the peninsula.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in Crimea as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to Crimea.</p>

<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Kinshasa due to extremely limited infrastructure and poor security conditions, notably in eastern DRC and Kasais.</p>

<title>Worldwide Caution - Caution</title><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html</guid><dc:identifier>
caution</dc:identifier>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>This latest update to the Department of State&#8217;s Worldwide Caution provides U.S. citizens with general information regarding terrorist activities, political violence and criminal activity that transpire abroad, as well as specific recommendations on how to prepare for possible contingencies, receive information on breaking security events and ensure that travelers can be contacted in an emergency. This version replaces the Worldwide Caution dated July 2, 2018.</p>
<p>As terrorist attacks, political violence (including demonstrations), criminal activities and other security incidents often take place without any warning, U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and practice good situational awareness when traveling abroad. When planning a trip and prior to departing the United States, U.S. citizens should consult country specific&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html">Travel Advisories</a>&nbsp;and information pages on&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en.html">travel.state.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Travelers are also urged to enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(STEP) to receive security messages and to make it easier to locate you in an emergency. The Department uses these security messages to convey information about terrorist threats, security incidents, planned demonstrations, natural disasters, etc. In an emergency, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate or call the following numbers:&nbsp;<b>1 (888) 407-4747</b>&nbsp;(toll-free in the United States and Canada) or&nbsp;<b>1 (202) 501-4444</b>&nbsp;from other countries.</p>
<p>U.S. government facilities worldwide actively monitor potential security threats and may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture. In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups including ISIS, al-Qa'ida, their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens wherever they are. Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods, including edged weapons, pistols and vehicles, as weapons to effectively target crowds. Extremists increasingly aim to identify and attack &quot;soft&quot; targets, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)</li>
<li>hotels, clubs and restaurants</li>
<li>places of worship</li>
<li>schools</li>
<li>parks</li>
<li>shopping malls and markets</li>
<li>tourism infrastructure and tourist sites</li>
<li>public transportation systems</li>
<li>airports</li>
</ul>
<p>In multiple regions, terrorists, guerrilla groups and criminals seek to kidnap U.S. citizens to finance their operations or for political purposes. The Department also remains concerned that terrorists could again seek to down aircraft using concealed explosives or hijack commercial flights.</p>
<p>Private U.S. citizens should not travel to any country to participate in armed conflict. U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of, or providing other forms of support to, designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a serious crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Northern Border Region &#8211; Level 3: Reconsider Travel</b></p>
<p>Extremist groups have carried out attacks in adjacent areas of Burkina Faso. Attacks may occur with little or no warning.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in areas north and northeast of the city of Dapaong, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these areas.</p>

<p><b>The Cities of Sokod&#233;, Bafilo, and Mango &#8211; Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution</b></p>
<p>There is a history of violent demonstrations in Sokod&#233;, Bafilo, and Mango, during which protesters and security force members have been injured and some killed. Police have used tear gas to disperse demonstrations that caused traffic disruptions in city centers and along National Route 1 and arrested demonstrators. Security forces have at times used excessive force to disperse crowds. Authorities have interrupted internet and cellular data services during past protests, making communication difficult and unpredictable.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Nicaragua - Level 3: Reconsider Travel</title><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/nicaragua-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/nicaragua-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Reconsider travel to Nicaragua due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>,&nbsp;<b>civil unrest</b>, <b>limited healthcare availability, and arbitrary enforcement of laws</b>.</p>
<p>On September 12, 2018, the U.S. Department of State lifted the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel and family members. The U.S. Embassy remains open to provide emergency services for U.S. citizens and will gradually return to normal operations.</p>
<p>Throughout Nicaragua, armed and violent uniformed police or civilians in plain clothes acting as police (&#8220;para-police&#8221;) are targeting anyone considered to be in opposition to the rule of President Ortega.&nbsp; The government and its affiliated armed groups have been reported to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitrarily detain protestors, with credible claims of torture and disappearances.</li>
<li>Systematically target opposition figures, including clergy members.</li>
<li>Prevent certain individuals from departing Nicaragua by air or land.</li>
<li>Seize privately owned land.</li>
<li>Arbitrarily search personal phones and computers for anti-government content.</li>
<li>Arbitrarily detain certain individuals with unfounded charges of terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime.</li>
</ul>
<p>These police and para-police groups often cover their faces, sometimes operate in groups numbering in the hundreds, and use unmarked vehicles.</p>
<p>Rallies and demonstrations are widespread and occur daily around the country. Government forces, uniformed police and para-police have attacked peaceful demonstrators leading to significant numbers of deaths and injuries. Looting, vandalism, and arson often occur during unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Road blocks, including in Managua and other major cities, may appear and limit availability of food and fuel.</p>
<p>Government hospitals are understaffed and may deny treatment to suspected protestors. Some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies.&nbsp; Ambulances have reportedly refused to respond or have been denied access to areas with individuals needing emergency care.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as sexual assault and armed robbery, is common.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Managua is limited in the assistance it can provide. U.S. government personnel in Nicaragua must avoid unnecessary travel and remain in their homes between 10:00 p.m. and sunrise. They are prohibited from traveling outside of Managua and are advised to avoid demonstrations. Additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel may be put in place at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.</p>
<p>Read the Safety and Security section on the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Nicaragua.html">country information page</a>.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Nicaragua:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider arrangements to depart the country quickly. There are no plans for a U.S. government-assisted evacuation.</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations. &nbsp;Restrict unnecessary travel.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to drive through crowds, barricades, or road blocks.</li>
<li>Maintain adequate supplies of food, cash, potable water, and fuel if sheltering in place.</li>
<li>Ensure your U.S. passport is valid and available for a quick departure from the country, if needed.</li>
<li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.</li>
<li>Keep a low profile.</li>
<li>Do not display signs of wealth such as expensive watches or jewelry.</li>

<p><b>Phnom Penh</b></p>
<p>Street crime, particularly phone and bag snatchings, occurs frequently in areas where foreigners gather; resistance can result in injury. We urge all travelers to be aware of their surroundings at all time and to be extra vigilant when displaying items like jewelry, bags and cell phones in public. Violent crime, such as sexual assault and homicide, is common, sometimes against foreigners.</p>
<p>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Use caution when walking or driving at night.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces</b></p>
<p>Land mines and unexploded ordnance are found in very remote areas throughout Cambodia, and especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces.</p>
<p>Do not touch unknown metal objects; instead notify the Cambodia Mine Action Center at 012-800-473/023-995-437. Use a local guide when walking in forested areas or dry rice paddies in these areas.</p>

<description><![CDATA[

<title>Iraq - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title><pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2018</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/iraq-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/iraq-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to Iraq due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism and armed conflict</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur frequently in many areas of the country, including Baghdad.</p>
<p>The U.S. government&#8217;s ability to provide routine and emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq is extremely limited. &nbsp;On October 18, 2018, the Department of State ordered the temporary suspension of operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah.&nbsp; The American Citizens Services (ACS) Section at the U.S. Embassy Baghdad will continue to provide consular services to U.S. citizens in Basrah.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to Syria to engage in armed conflict, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government stated that it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the border. Additionally, fighting on behalf of, or supporting designated terrorist organizations, is a crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Iraq, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/iraq-travel-advisory.html#ExternalPopup">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Yemen - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/yemen-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/yemen-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to Yemen due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism, civil unrest, health risks, and armed conflict</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terrorist groups continue to plot and conduct attacks in Yemen. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Additionally, there is a continuing threat of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminal elements, and/or non-government actors. Employees of western organizations may be targeted for attack or kidnapping.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Sana&#8217;a suspended its operations in February 2015. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Yemen.</p>
<p>No part of Yemen is immune to violence. Critical levels of violence, to include armed conflict, artillery shelling, and air strikes, persist throughout the country. There are also reports of landmines throughout Yemen.</p>
<p>Military conflict has caused significant destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities.This limits the availability of electricity, clean water, and medical care. This instability often hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver critically needed food, medicine, and water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yemen is home to the world's largest cholera outbreak, and the disease is present throughout the entire country. Due to the ongoing security situation, there is limited availability of food, electricity, water, medicine and medical supplies; adequate medical treatment is unavailable.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a></u>.</p>

<p>Exercise increased caution in India due to <b>crime and terrorism.</b>&nbsp;Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The state of Jammu and Kashmir (except the eastern Ladakh region and its capital, Leh) due to <b>terrorism and civil unrest</b>.</li>
<li>Within 10 km of the India-Pakistan border due to <b>the potential for armed conflict.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Indian authorities report rape is one of the fastest growing crimes in India. Violent crime, such as sexual assault, has occurred at tourist sites and in other locations.</p>
<p>Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in rural areas from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these areas.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p><b>State of Jammu and Kashmir</b></p>
<p>Terrorist attacks and violent civil unrest are possible in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Avoid all travel to this state (with the exception of visits to the eastern Ladakh region and its capital, Leh). Sporadic violence occurs particularly along the Line of Control (LOC) separating India and Pakistan, and in tourist destinations in the Kashmir Valley: Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam. The Indian government prohibits foreign tourists from visiting certain areas along the LOC.</p>

<p><b>India-Pakistan Border</b></p>
<p>India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. The only official India-Pakistan border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the state of Punjab between Atari, India, and Wagah, Pakistan. The border crossing is usually open, but confirm the current status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. A Pakistani visa is required to enter Pakistan. Only U.S. citizens residing in India may apply for a Pakistani visa in India. Otherwise apply for a Pakistani visa in your country of residence before traveling to India.</p>

<p><b>Central and East India</b></p>
<p>Maoist extremist groups, or &#8220;Naxalites,&#8221; are active in a large swath of India from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal, particularly in rural parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and on the borders of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha. The Naxalites have conducted frequent terrorist attacks on local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the fluid nature of the threat, all U.S. government travelers to states with Naxalite activity must receive special authorization from the U.S. consulate responsible for the area to be visited. U.S. officials traveling only to the capital cities in these states do not need prior authorization.</p>

<title>Haiti - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/haiti-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/haiti-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to Haiti due to&nbsp;<b>crime </b>and <b>civil unrest</b>.</p>
<p>There are currently widespread, violent, and unpredictable demonstrations in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in Haiti.&nbsp; Due to these demonstrations, on February 14, 2019, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Haiti.</p>
<p>Protests, tire burning, and road blockages are frequent and unpredictable.&nbsp; Violent crime, such as armed robbery, is common. Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents, and emergency response, including ambulance service, is limited or non-existent.</p>
<p>Travelers are sometimes targeted, followed, and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. The U.S. Embassy requires its personnel to use official transportation to and from the airport, and it takes steps to detect surveillance and deter criminal attacks during these transports.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens due to reduced staffing and security concerns. The Embassy discourages its personnel from walking in most neighborhoods. The Embassy prohibits its personnel from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visiting establishments after dark without secure, on-site parking;</li>
<li>Using any kind of public transportation or taxis;</li>
<li>Visiting banks and using ATMs;</li>
<li>Driving outside of Port-au-Prince at night;</li>
<li>Traveling anywhere between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.; and</li>
<li>Visiting certain parts of the city at any time without prior approval and special security measures in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the Safety and Security section on the&nbsp;<u><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Haiti.html">country information page</a></u>.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Haiti:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid demonstrations.&nbsp; Do not attempt to drive through roadblocks.</li>
<li>Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival.</li>
<li>Be careful about providing your destination address in Haiti. Do not provide personal information to unauthorized individuals located&nbsp;in the immigration,&nbsp;customs, or other&nbsp;areas inside&nbsp;or near&nbsp;any airports in Haiti.</li>
<li>As you leave the airport, make sure you are not being followed. If you notice you are being followed, drive to the nearest police station immediately.</li>
<li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li>
<li>Purchase travel insurance and medical evacuation insurance ahead of time.</li>
<li>Review information on&nbsp;<u><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a></u>.&nbsp;</li>

<title>Burundi - Level 3: Reconsider Travel</title><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2018</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/burundi-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/burundi-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Reconsider travel to Burundi due to <b>crime</b> <b>and</b> <b>armed conflict</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Violent crimes, such as grenade attacks and armed robbery, are common.&nbsp; Although Westerners are less likely to be specific targets, the risk related of &#8220;wrong time, wrong place&#8221; remains. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious crime.</p>
<p>There are ongoing political tensions in Burundi, and there has been sporadic violence throughout the country, including frequent gunfire and grenade attacks. Police and military checkpoints are common and can restrict freedom of movement. &nbsp;Police have searched the homes of private citizens as part of larger weapons searches.</p>
<p>The provinces of Cibitoke and Bubanza are vulnerable to occasional cross-border raids by armed groups from the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where violent clashes continue. The border may close without notice.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Burundi, and medical services in Burundi fall well below U.S. standards. U.S. embassy personnel are subject to restrictions when traveling in certain areas of Burundi and may be subject to other constraints as security conditions warrant. These restrictions include limitations on travel outside of Bujumbura during hours of darkness (typically 6:00 p.m.to 6:00 a.m.) and advance coordination for travel to the Bujumbura neighborhoods of Buyenzi, Bwiza, Cibitoke, Gasenyi, Kamenge, Kinama, Musaga, Mutakura, and Ngagara.</p>

<li>Remain aware of your surroundings and be vigilant when traveling in unfamiliar areas or outside of cities and along border areas; take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security.</li>
<li>Consider traveling in pairs and using convoys of multiple vehicles to mitigate the threat of roadside hoodlums when traveling outside of Bujumbura. Carry additional fuel, spare tires, and provisions. Include a satellite phone, map, navigation equipment, and first aid kit. Service stations are scarce in rural areas.

<p>Reconsider travel to Pakistan due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Please read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism.&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>The Azad Kashmir area due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Pakistan. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and&nbsp;government facilities.&nbsp;Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past, and information suggests they continue to do so.</p>
<p>Terrorist attacks continue to happen across Pakistan, with most occurring in Balochistan and KPK, including the former FATA. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in hundreds of casualties over the last several years.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. Travel by U.S. government personnel within Pakistan is restricted, and additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel outside of U.S. diplomatic facilities may occur at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar is unable to provide any consular services to U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or near Pakistan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)</a>.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to Venezuela due to <b>crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>On March 11, 2019, the U.S. Department of State announced the temporary suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas and the withdrawal of diplomatic personnel from Venezuela<b>.&nbsp;</b>The U.S. Embassy in Caracas is not providing any consular services. U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Venezuela should depart Venezuela.&nbsp; Commercial flights remain available.</p>
<p>The safety and security of U.S. citizens is our highest priority. If you are a U.S. citizen in Venezuela in need of assistance, or are concerned about a U.S. citizen in Venezuela, please contact the Department of State in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Visit our website</b> <a href="https://tfa.state.gov/" adhocenable="false">Task Force Alert</a> and select &#8220;2019 Venezuela Unrest&#8221;; or</li>
<li><b>Email</b> <a href="mailto:VenezuelaEmergencyUSC@state.gov">VenezuelaEmergencyUSC@state.gov</a>&nbsp; and provide as much information as possible (at a minimum, please provide the full name, gender, and last known location and/or contact information of the U.S. citizen); or</li>
<li><b>Call</b> us at 1-888-407-4747 (from the U.S. &amp; Canada), +1-202-501-4444 (from Overseas).</li>
</ul>
<p>Violent crime, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, is common.</p>
<p>Political rallies and demonstrations occur, often with little notice. Demonstrations typically elicit a strong police and security force response that includes the use of tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets against participants and occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism.</p>
<p>There are shortages of food, electricity, water, medicine, and medical supplies throughout much of Venezuela. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/health-infrastructure-breakdown-venezuela">Level 3 &#8216;Avoid Nonessential Travel&#8217;</a> notice on May 15, 2018 due to inadequate healthcare and the breakdown of the medical infrastructure in Venezuela. Consular access to detained U.S. citizens who also have Venezuelan nationality is severely restricted by the Venezuelan government.</p>
<p>Security forces have arbitrarily detained U.S. citizens for long periods. The U.S. Department of State may not be notified of the detention of a U.S. citizen, and consular access to detainees may be denied or severely delayed.</p>
<p>Read the Safety and Security section on the <a adhocenable="false" href="/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Venezuela.html">country information page</a>.</p>
<p>If you decide to travel to Venezuela:</p>

<title>Lebanon - Level 3: Reconsider Travel</title><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/lebanon-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/lebanon-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Reconsider travel Lebanon due to <b>crime,</b> <b>terrorism, </b>and<b> armed conflict</b>. Please read the entire Travel Advisory.</p>
<p>Do not travel to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the border with Syria due to <b>terrorism</b> <b>and</b> <b>armed conflict</b></li>
<li>the border with Israel due to <b>the potential for</b> <b>armed conflict</b></li>
<li>refugee settlements due to <b>the potential for</b> <b>armed conflict</b></li>
</ul>
<p>U.S. citizens should reconsider or avoid travel to certain areas in Lebanon because of the threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping, and outbreaks of violence, especially near Lebanon&#8217;s borders with Syria and Israel. U.S. citizens living and working in Lebanon should be aware of the risks of remaining in the country and should carefully consider those risks.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security restrictions. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. The potential exists for death or injury in Lebanon because of the attacks and bombings perpetrated by terrorist groups. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.</p>
<p>The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning. Armed clashes have occurred along the Lebanese borders, in Beirut, and in refugee settlements. The Lebanese Armed Forces have been brought in to quell the violence in these situations.</p>
<p>Public demonstrations can occur with little warning and could become violent. You should avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings. Protesters have blocked major roads to gain publicity for their causes, including the primary road to the U.S. Embassy, and the primary road between downtown Beirut and Rafiq Hariri International Airport. Access to the airport may be cut off if the security situation deteriorates.</p>
<p>Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Border with Syria</b></p>
<p>Since August 2014, deadly terror attacks have occurred in border towns along Lebanon&#8217;s border with Syria, as have episodic clashes between the Lebanese Army and Syrian-based violent extremist groups. A 2017 Lebanese Army offensive expelled ISIS militants from territory along Lebanon&#8217;s border with Syria. The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region. The U.S. Department of State also warns U.S. citizens of the risk of traveling on flights that fly over Syria, which include some flights to Beirut.</p>

<p><b>Border with Israel</b></p>
<p>There have been sporadic rocket attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel in connection with the violence between Israel and Hizballah: the last reported incident was in 2014. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid this border area.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to Iran due to the risk of <b>arbitrary</b> <b>arrest and detention of U.S. citizens</b>.</p>
<p>There is a very high risk of arrest and detention of U.S. citizens in Iran, particularly U.S.-Iranian dual nationals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens, including students, journalists, business travelers, and academics, on charges including espionage and posing a threat to national security. U.S.-Iranian dual nationals are particularly susceptible to arrest for these charges. Consular access to detained U.S. citizens is often denied.</p>
<p>The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with Iran. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iran. Switzerland serves as the protecting power for U.S. citizens in Iran, providing limited emergency services. The Iranian government routinely delays or denies Swiss officials access to detained U.S. citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Iran, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.<i></i></p>

<p>Reconsider travel to Niger due to <b>crime</b> and <b>terrorism</b>.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, is common.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting kidnappings and possible attacks in Niger. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities and areas frequented by Westerners. Terrorists operate in the areas bordering Mali, Libya, Burkina Faso, and throughout northern Niger. Avoid travel to Niger&#8217;s border regions, particularly the Malian border area, Diffa region, and the Lake Chad region. Mali-based extremist groups have crossed the border and conducted multiple lethal attacks on Nigerien security forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in remote and rural areas as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of the capital, Niamey, due to security concerns. Outside of Niamey, all U.S. Embassy personnel are required to travel only during daylight hours and in a minimum of a two-vehicle convoy accompanied by armed Nigerien government security escorts.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Libya - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2018</pubDate><link>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/libya-travel-advisory.html</link><guid>http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/libya-travel-advisory.html</guid><dc:identifier>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Do not travel to Libya due to <b>crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict</b>.</p>
<p>Crime levels in Libya remain high, including the threat of kidnapping for ransom. Westerners and U.S. citizens have been targets of these crimes.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Libya. Violent extremist activity in Libya remains high, and extremist groups have made threats against U.S. government officials, citizens, and interests. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.</p>
<p>Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, Sabha, and Dernah, have witnessed fighting among armed groups, as well as terrorist attacks. Hotels and airports frequented by Westerners have been caught in the crossfire. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.</p>
<p>Militia groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to a lawyer or legal process, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment.</p>
<p>Some international and national airports are closed, and flights out of operational airports are sporadic and may be cancelled without warning. The U.S. government is very concerned about the targeting of commercial transportation in Libya and prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency or routine assistance to U.S. citizens in Libya, as the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli suspended its operations in July 2014.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>
<p>Read the Safety and Security section on the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Libya.html">country information page</a>.</p>

<li>Carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times.</li>
<li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li>
<li>Make contingency plans to leave.</li>
<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or a power of attorney.</li>
<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, and etcetera.</li>

<p>Incidents of civil unrest and ethnic violence may occur without warning.</p>
<p>The Government of Ethiopia has restricted or shut down internet, cellular data, and phone services during and after civil unrest. These restrictions impede the U.S. Embassy&#8217;s ability to communicate with, and provide consular services to, U.S. citizens in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Addis Ababa.&nbsp; As a precaution, U.S. government personnel must request permission for any travel outside of Addis Ababa (personal and official), and are required to carry personnel tracking devices and, in some cases, satellite phones. U.S. government personnel and their families may not travel to the areas listed as Level 3 and Level 4 in this Travel Advisory except for official business and with prior approval from the Embassy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Exercise increased caution in South Africa due to <b>crime, civil unrest,</b> <b>and drought</b>.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, rape, carjacking, mugging, and &quot;smash-and-grab&quot; attacks on vehicles, is common. There is a higher risk of violent crime in the central business districts of major cities after dark.</p>
<p>Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. These can develop quickly without prior notification, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services; such events have the potential to turn violent.</p>
<p>South Africa&#8217;s Western, Eastern, and Northern Cape Provinces are experiencing a severe drought. Water supplies in some areas may be affected. Residential water-use restrictions are in place in Cape Town and other municipalities. Please see links below for current information.</p>

<li>Avoid visiting informal settlement areas unless you are with someone familiar with the area.</li>
<li>Do not display cash or valuables.</li>
